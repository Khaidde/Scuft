    Ideas
        All variables are immutable by default
            a: num = 3; //immutable
            a: ~num ~= 4 //mutable
        Typeof
            type Particle {
                a: num;
                b: num;
            }
            //base includes num, string, boolean, void, type

            a = Particle {
                a = 3;
                b = 3;
            }

            b = typeof a {
                // has = or ~=
            }

            daysUntilChristmas = 2;
            typeof daysUntilChristmas; // num
            a: typeof daysUntilChristmas; //This may or may not be allowed 

            //Typeof can work on any declared variable
            // typeof Particle is not allowed because Particle is not a declared variable
            // typeof for and typeof type is not allowed for similar reasons
        metaprogramming
            nameof (a) // "a"
            particle: Particle = factory(Particle);
            factory = (a: type) -> ??? {
                obj = a {};
                return obj;
            }
        Function Overloading
            // associate parameter dec with function identifier
            \x = x * x
            
            add: (num, num) -> num = (n0: num, n1: num) -> num {
                ...
            }
            add = (s0 : ~string, s1 : string) -> ~string {
                ...
            }
            add = 3; // have to check if it's a function

            // Functions will have their types adjust for this issue (provided the functions are constant)
            // This would break variables, since then a = 2; a = 3; would be valid syntax

    Small Tasks
    - During parsing, if blocks, function blocks, etc. are not checked for type definitions or modules
        - Prevent user from including type definitions/modules in function blocks in a later stage  
    - Assert that variable declarations must either have a type declaration OR assignment: "variable;" should be invalid
        - Error outputed that "Expressions can't serve as statements in this language"

12/24/20 (Thursday)
    Tasks 
    - Make semi-colons optional for function declarations
    - For/while loops
    - If/elseif/else conditionals
    - Dot expressions for types
    - Lambda parsing

    Small Tasks
    - Tested every error message to ensure that they all generally work as expected
    - Made semi-colons optional for function declarations
    - Made change in parseExpression so that "a = 3 [ 5" passes through parseExpression. Should test all error messages again
        - Made a couple tweaks to the parseExpression function as a whole
    - If/elseif/else conditionals
    - while loops

12/25/20 (Friday)
    Tasks 
    - Dot expressions for types
    - Lambda parsing
    - Continue/break statements;

    Ideas
        For loops (remove while loops and only have for loops)
            for i in [0, 20) {
                ...
            }

            for item, index in array {

            }

            for array {
                doStuffOnItemInArray( ... );
            }

    Small Tasks
    - Implemented all cases of for loops. Make sure that the error messages are working as expected
    - Implemented continue/break statements
    - Implemented dot operator for most cases. Still needs some testing and potential error messages

12/26/20 (Saturday)
    Tasks
    - Make sure that the for loop error messages are working as expected
    - Make sure dot operator error messages are working as expected
    - Fix invalid use of dot operator in parameter declaration: add = (a:num, b.pos.x: num) {}
    - Verify error messages again in while loops of parseType, parseTypeConstruction, parseFunction, parseCall
    - Finally start on type checking/semantic analysis

    Ideas
        Constant Variable Ordering

            //This should definitely work
            immutA = 3 + (\x,y x * y)(5, 10);
            immutB = 4 + (7);

            immutableVar = constA;

            add = subtract; //queue (subtract -> table)
            subtract = add; //throw error
            doOtherStuff = () -> num {
                test = value;

                value => add(randConst, 2); //immutable, constant. determine if add is pure, determine if randConst is constant

                randConst => 3; //constant

                return constA;
            }
            constB = doOtherStuff();
            add: |(num, num) -> num => (a: num, b: num) -> num { //pure
                return a + b;
            }

            //This might also work?
            doStuff = () {
                // print(mutVar) This line would throw an error because mutable is not known at compile time
                print(constA); //This line works

                mutVar ~= 0;
                mutVar ~= mutVar + 1; //Note that mutVar variables must be declared in order 
                print(add(mutVar + constA, constB));

                // Const variables can be declared out of order (in this case: end of the scope)
                constA = 3;
                constB = 4;

                // Const variable declaration being assign a function as a value
                add = (a: num, b: num) -> num {
                    return a + b;
                }
            }

    Small Tasks
    - Created getAssertedToken() function to generalize asserting a token and calling nextToken()
    - Fixed errors in the error handling of parseExpression along with some niche but important test cases
        - Made parseExpression function error messages more debuggable by using two part errors
    - Output error when user uses the dot operator in the parameter declaration of a function: add = (a:num, b.pos.x: num) {}
    - Output error when block comment does not have a matching */ at the end of the file. Formatted lexer errors to fit format of parser errors.
    - Fixed issues with type construction in the conditional expressions of if statements and while loops
        - Type construction must be contained within parenthesis when used in if statements or whiles loops
        - if testPoint == (Point{x = 3, y = 2}) { doSomething(); }

12/27/20 (Sunday)
    Tasks
    - Make sure that the for loop error messages are working as expected
    - Make sure dot operator error messages are working as expected
    - Verify error messages again in while loops of parseType, parseTypeConstruction, parseFunction, parseCall
    - Get dot operator working for expressions: (funcCall().value + 3) - Point{ x = 3, y = 2 }.name.stringVal ^ 2;
    - Finally start on type checking/semantic analysis

    Ideas
        Adjusted type construction syntax 
            with Astrology;
            p = Particle {x = 3, y = 4}
            if p == Particle w/ {x = 3, y= 4} {
            
            }
        Constant declarations
            test => 4;
            
            otherVal1 ~= sideEffect();

            MAX_PLAYERS_IN_LOBBY => 50;
            constVal => 6
            otherVal2 => 3 + add(3, 2) + constVal; 
            add => (a: num, b: num) -> num {
                return a + b;
            }

            test2 ~= 3;
            if 
                test2 ++;
            else
                test2 = 0; 
            otherStuff = test2;

            sideEffect = (num) -> num { //Not a pure function so sideEffect can't be defined as const (=>)
                otherVal2 = 2;
                return otherVal1 +;
            }

    Small Tasks
    - Small modifications to error for type construction in conditional expressions of if statements and while loops
    - For loops can now store expressions for their upper and lower bounds

    Issues
    - With new changes to how expressions work the following issues arise:
        - the iterable name of for loops is ambiguous. Consider these cases
            for item, index in (variable.otherVariable.x, 3 - 8] {}
            for item, index in (variable.otherVariable.x) {}
